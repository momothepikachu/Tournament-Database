# Tournament-Database
    Project Overview
In this project, I'll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.

I will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. Use Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

    Why This Project?
Modern data-driven applications require developers that know how to store data and interact programmatically with that data. In this project, youâ€™ll design a database based off of a provided specification and use case and then write code that makes use of that data.
