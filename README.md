# Tournament-Database
    Project Overview
In this project, I'll be writing a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

This project has two parts: defining the database schema (SQL table definitions), and writing the code that will use it.

I will develop a database schema to store the game matches between players. Use Python module to rank the players and pair them up in matches in a tournament.

    Why This Project?
Modern data-driven applications require developers that know how to store data and interact programmatically with that data. In this project, youâ€™ll design a database based off of a provided specification and use case and then write code that makes use of that data.

    Using the Vagrant Virtual Machine
The Vagrant VM has PostgreSQL installed and configured, as well as the psql command line interface (CLI) , so that you don't have to install or configure them on your local machine.

To use the Vagrant virtual machine, navigate to the full-stack-nanodegree-vm/tournament (fork https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm) directory in the terminal, then use the command vagrant up (powers on the virtual machine) followed by vagrant ssh (logs into the virtual machine) .
