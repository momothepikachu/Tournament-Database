¡ñ tournament.sql - this file is used to set up your database schema (the table
representation of your data structure).

functions which can add, delete or query data in your database to another python
program (a client program). Remember that when you define a function, it does not
execute, it simply means the function is defined to run a specific set of instructions when
called.

the tournament.py module. We've written this client program to test your implementation
of functions in tournament.py
